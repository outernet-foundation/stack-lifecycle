# stack-lifecycle

Docker-stack lifecycle commands — `up`, `down`, `build` — with a native/consumer split. A repo that authors its own stack (Dockerfiles + `compose.bake.yml`) uses the native mode: multi-file compose assembly, per-service SHA injection, `.env.lock` resolution. A consumer repo that OCI-includes an already-baked upstream stack uses the same commands as a thin wrapper: single-graph, `.env`-only, no build path.

See [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for the file/layout conventions the commands assume (`compose.bake.yml`, `.env.lock`, `.env.shas`, `PUBLIC_URL` / `AUTH_MODE` in `.env`) and the mode-detection contract.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.13+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage

From a stack repo's root:

```bash
uv run up                      # docker compose up (auto-detects GPU; native or consumer per compose.bake.yml)
uv run up --build              # build images locally first (native only)
uv run up --gpu none           # override GPU auto-detection
uv run down                    # docker compose down
uv run down -v                 # also remove named volumes
uv run build                   # cross-build all images per compose.bake.yml
uv run build --lock-only       # refresh .env.lock without building
```

## Consuming from another repo

git-reference the package and use its entry points from your own `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = ["stack-lifecycle"]

[tool.uv.sources]
stack-lifecycle = { git = "https://github.com/outernet-foundation/stack-lifecycle.git", rev = "<pin-a-commit-sha>" }
bashrun = { git = "https://github.com/outernet-foundation/bashrun.git", rev = "<pin-a-commit-sha>" }
```

`bashrun` is `stack-lifecycle`'s only non-PyPI dependency, so its git source has to be declared alongside — uv's `[tool.uv.sources]` are not transitive.

## Development

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run basedpyright
uv run pytest
```
